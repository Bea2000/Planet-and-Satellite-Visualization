# Planet and Satellite Visualization

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Information Visualization course during the second semester of 2022 at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. Using the D3.js library, the project provides interactive visualizations of the solar system, displaying the planets and their satellites.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To visualize the planets in the solar system using both logarithmic and linear scales to represent distances and sizes, respectively.
- To allow users to interact with the visualizations by hovering and clicking on planets and satellites, highlighting relevant information and categories.
- To filter and organize satellite data based on user-defined criteria, offering an intuitive exploration of planetary satellites.

## Data Source

The data used for these visualizations was extracted from [Devstronomy](https://devstronomy.com).

## Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Planets of the Solar System

- The first visualization displays the Sun and the planets in our solar system, positioned according to a logarithmic distance scale and represented by a linear size scale.
- Colors reflect the average temperature of each planet.
- **Interactions**:
  - Hovering over a planet reveals detailed information.
  - Clicking on a planet highlights other planets that either take less or more than 26 years to orbit the Sun. The corresponding satellites of these planets are also shown in the second visualization.

### Visualization 2: Satellite Visualization

- The second visualization focuses on the satellites of the planets selected from the first visualization.
- Users can filter satellites by radius and sort them by name or albedo (reflectivity).
- **Interactions**:
  - Hovering over a satellite displays its information and highlights the satellite by lowering the opacity of the others.
  - Satellite arms represent albedo, while the head size of the satellite icons indicates the size of the satellite.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local HTTP server:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

    Then, open `http://ip:port` in your browser.

## Interactions and Filtering

- In the first visualization, clicking on a planet filters based on its orbital category (less or more than 26 years).
- In the second visualization, you can filter satellites based on size and sort them by name or albedo using buttons.
- The visualizations are interactive, allowing users to hover and explore detailed information for planets and satellites.
